# Medical Murder Mystery

[My Notes](../notes.md)

Medical Murdery Mystery is a game where players act as characters working in a hospital. Each player will be able to navigate around the simple map, entering rooms one by one. As they do, they will be able to suspect their fellow players of murder by various means in multiple possible locations. It's based off of the popular board game Clue, but with a medical spin on it. Players will also be able to go back and see accusations made against them.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Want to be the best investigator in town? Good at sniffing out yoru suspicious friends? Then Medical Murdery Mystery is the game for you! Take on the role of a medical worker in Provo City Hospital where a mysterious murder has taken place. The Provo police have tasked you and your coworkers with finding the culprit, but you suspect it was one of them, or perhaps even yourself. Come play and find out!

### Design

<img src="MMM_login.png" alt="Login-Image" style="width:40%; height:auto;">
<img src="board.png" alt="Login-Image" style="width:30%; height:auto;">

These two images are mockups of the site and board. There is a simple login page, and there is the playing page, which will include the board. I will probably make the board more visually interesting as well. The playing page will include some player information and display the current suspicions being voiced by other players.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - It uses HTML to define the structure of the webpages. There will be three pages:
    1. The login page.
    2. The playing page with the game board.
    3. The history page to see past suspicions and accusations.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to make the the app look appealing, as well as make it fit on multiple screen sizes.
- **JavaScript** - JavaScript will define the main functionality of moving on the board and submitting suspicions.
- **React** - React will be responsible for tying together the HTML, CSS, and JS. It will also handle the routing.
- **Service** - There will be multiple service endpoints:
    * Backend service for logging in
    * Sending board moves and suspicions to the backend
    * Retrieving history of suspicions to display
    * Using an API like [RPG Dice Roller](https://rpg-dice-roller-api.djpeacher.com/) to retrieve a random dice roll
- **DB/Login** - The database will store players' credentials and allow them to log in, which is required to play. The database will also store the history of suspicions the player has made.
- **WebSocket** - WebSocket will broadcast the current board and player suspicions in real-time to other players.
