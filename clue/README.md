# (Medical Murder Mystery) Online Clue Clone
This was a secondary idea I had for my startup that I'm going to work on simultaneously. I'm not sure I want to use it, but to make sure it demonstrates the proper commits if I do use it, I'm going to keep it here in the startup repo.

# Medical Murder Mystery

[My Notes](../notes.md)

Medical Murdery Mystery is a game where players act as characters working in a hospital. Each player will be able to navigate around the simple map, entering rooms one by one. As they do, they will be able to suspect their fellow players of murder by various means in multiple possible locations. It's based off of the popular board game Clue, but with a medical spin on it.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

Want to be the best investigator in town? Good at sniffing out yoru suspicious friends? Then Medical Murdery Mystery is the game for you!

### Design

<img src="MMM_login.png" alt="Login-Image" style="width:40%; height:auto;">
<img src="board.png" alt="Login-Image" style="width:30%; height:auto;">

These two images are mockups of the site and board. There is a simple login page, and there is the playing page, which will include the board. I will probably make the board more visually interesting as well. The playing page will include some player information and display the current suspicions being voiced by other players.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - It uses HTML to define the structure of the webpages. There will be three pages:
    1. The login page.
    2. The drawing canvas/the input box for guessing.
    3. The leaderboard page to show who has the most wins.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to make the the app look appealing, as well as make it fit on multiple screen sizes.
- **React** - React will make the main functionality of drawing on the canvas and making guesses possible. It will also be used for logging in to the site and page routing.
- **Service** - There will be multiple service endpoints:
    * Backend service for logging in
    * Submitting guesses and saving correct answers
    * Retrieving the leaderboard to display win counts
    * Using an API like [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs/) to retrieve a random prompt word to draw
- **DB/Login** - The database will store players' credentials and allow them to log in, which is required to play. The database will also store the number of wins for each user to be ranked on the leaderboard.
- **WebSocket** - WebSocket will broadcast the current canvas and player guesses and alert when someone has guessed correctly.
