# DrawnLine

[My Notes](notes.md)

DrawnLine is an app that allows users to play receive a random word, and then draw it. That image will be transmitted to other players, and those players will have to guess what it is. Think of it like online charades, but drawing! Players will earn points by guessing correctly, and the person that gets the most correct in a session wins. The number of correct guess will be stored and displayed in a leaderboard to see who the best guesser is overall.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - It uses HTML to define the structure of the webpages. There will be three pages:
    1. The login page.
    2. The drawing canvas/the input boxes for guessing.
    3. The leaderboard page to show who has the most correct guesses over all time.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to make the the app look appealing, as well as make it fit on multiple screen sizes.
- **React** - React will make the main functionality of drawing on the canvas and making guesses possible. It will also be used for logging in to the site and page routing.
- **Service** - There will be multiple service endpoints:
    * Backend service for logging in
    * Submitting guesses and saving correct answers
    * Organizing the leaderboard to display best guessers
    * Using an API like [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs/) to retrieve a random prompt word to draw
- **DB/Login** - The database will store players' credentials and allow them to log in, which is required to play. The database will also store the number of correct guesses for each user to be ranked on the overall leaderboard.
- **WebSocket** - WebSocket will broadcast the current canvas and player guesses and alert when someone has guessed correctly.
