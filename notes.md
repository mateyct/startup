# CS 260 Notes

### First notes (From GitHub Reading)
I already knew a lot about GitHub and Git before reading this, but I did learn that you can create a new repository using another one as a template. This could be helpful for me at some point.

[My startup](http://18.233.173.238)

## To-Do
- I may need to add a panel for showing the recent guesses
- I might want to add a place for players to view the info they know
- Include a way for players to show the info they have?

## AWS Notes
- EC2 is a classification of server that you can run on.
- When setting up a server on AWS, the IP can change every time you restart, but if you use an elastic IP, it will allow you to keep it, but charge while the server is off.
- DNS is the Domain Namer Server, and it maps domain names to IP addresses.
- There are 4 layers of the internet
- Caddy use Let's Encrypt to generate certificates to make the file transfer more secure

## HTML Notes
- It's all about structure, but no styling
- The \<span> tag is inline
