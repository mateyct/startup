# CS 260 Notes

### First notes (From GitHub Reading)
I already knew a lot about GitHub and Git before reading this, but I did learn that you can create a new repository using another one as a template. This could be helpful for me at some point.

[My startup](http://18.233.173.238)

## To-Do
- I may need to add a panel for showing the recent guesses
- I might want to add a place for players to view the info they know
- Include a way for players to show the info they have?

## AWS Notes
- EC2 is a classification of server that you can run on.
- When setting up a server on AWS, the IP can change every time you restart, but if you use an elastic IP, it will allow you to keep it, but charge while the server is off.
- DNS is the Domain Namer Server, and it maps domain names to IP addresses.
- There are 4 layers of the internet
- Caddy use Let's Encrypt to generate certificates to make the file transfer more secure

## HTML Notes
- It's all about structure, but no styling
- The \<span> tag is inline

## CSS Notes

| Combinator       | Meaning                    | Example        | Description                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Descendant       | A list of descendants      | `body section` | Any section that is a descendant of a body |
| Child            | A list of direct children  | `section > p`  | Any p that is a direct child of a section  |
| General sibling  | A list of siblings         | `div ~ p`      | Any p that has a div sibling               |
| Adjacent sibling | A list of adjacent sibling | `div + p`      | Any p that has an adjacent div sibling     |

There are more combinators than I realized.

Attribute selector:
```css
p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
```


## Node Notes
Steps: 
1. Create your project directory
2. Initialize it for use with NPM by running npm init -y
3. Make sure .gitignore file contains node_modules
4. Install any desired packages with npm install <package name here>
5. Add require('<package name here>') to your application's JavaScript
6. Use the code the package provides in your JavaScript
7. Run your code with node index.js

With VS Code you can create a launch configuration that specifies the watch parameter when every you debug with VS Code. In VS Code press CTRL-SHIFT-P (on Windows) or âŒ˜-SHIFT-P (on Mac) and type the command Debug: Add configuration. Select the Node.js option. This will create a launch configuration named .vscode/launch.json. Modify the configuration so that it includes the --watch parameter. This should look something like the following.
